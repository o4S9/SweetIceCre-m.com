/// selection. Flutter typically draws this menu itself, but this class deals
/// with the platform-rendered context menu.
///
/// Only one instance can be visible at a time. Calling [show] while the system
/// context menu is already visible will hide it and show it again at the new
/// [Rect]. An instance that is hidden is informed via [onSystemHide].
///
/// Currently this system context menu is bound to text input. The buttons that
/// are shown and the actions they perform are dependent on the currently
/// active [TextInputConnection]. Using this without an active
/// [TextInputConnection] is a noop.
///
/// Call [dispose] when no longer needed.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ContextMenuController], which controls Flutter-drawn context menus.
///  * [SystemContextMenu], which wraps this functionality in a widget.
///  * [MediaQuery.maybeSupportsShowingSystemContextMenu], which indicates
///    whether the system context menu is supported.
